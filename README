This repository includes code examples for single sourcing with RAP and RCP.

com.eclipsesource.singlesourcing is a bundle to be used in both RAP and RCP.
com.eclipsesource.singlesourcing.rap and com.eclipsesource.singlesourcing.rcp are the corresponding fragments for RAP and RCP.
Add both the bundle itself and the one fragment that matches the respective platform to the deployment.
You can then instantiate a class like this:

ShoppingCart cart = SessionSingletonProvider.getInstance( ShoppingCart.class );

For every different session in RAP, a new instance will be created.
Whenever you call this method from the same session, you will receive the same instance.
In RCP, there will only be a single instance.

You can find further information in the single sourcing guide at http://eclipsesource.com/en/eclipse/eclipse-rap/
